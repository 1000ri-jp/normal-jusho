# Frequently Asked Questions

## General

### What is Jusho?

Jusho is a Japanese address normalization API. It takes free-form Japanese address strings and returns structured, validated data including postal codes, administrative codes, geographic coordinates, and kana readings.

### What data sources does Jusho use?

Jusho combines data from two authoritative government sources:

- **KOKUDO** (Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism / MLIT): Provides geographic coordinates, administrative codes, and detailed address data down to the block level.
- **KEN_ALL** (Japan Post): Provides postal codes, kana readings, and delivery-oriented address data.

Additionally, two specialized dictionaries are included:

- **Jigyosyo**: Business offices with dedicated postal codes (~23,000 entries).
- **Tatemono**: Large buildings with per-floor postal codes (~86 buildings).

### Is Jusho free?

The public API at `api.jusho.dev` is free to use within the rate limits (100 requests/minute per IP, 50,000 requests/hour globally).

### What license is Jusho under?

Jusho is released under the MIT License.

## API Usage

### What address formats are supported?

Jusho handles many Japanese address formats:

- Full addresses: `"東京都千代田区千代田1-1"`
- Without prefecture: `"渋谷区道玄坂1-2-3"` (auto-detected)
- With various number formats: `"千代田区千代田一丁目1番1号"`
- Business office names: `"宮内庁"`, `"株式会社日立製作所"`
- Building names with floors: `"六本木ヒルズ森タワー30F"`
- Mixed formats: `"大阪市北区梅田1-1-1"`

### Why are `address.pref` and `address_variants.kokudo.pref` different?

The `address` object uses kenall (Japan Post) as the preferred source for `pref` and `city`, since these are most commonly used for delivery and postal purposes. The `address_variants` object provides both kokudo (MLIT) and kenall representations so you can choose the appropriate one.

For example, the city `袖ケ浦市` is written with `ケ` (katakana ke) in Japan Post data but `ヶ` (small katakana ke) in MLIT data.

### What does `match_type` mean?

| Value | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `"address"` | Matched via standard address data (MLIT + Japan Post) |
| `"building"` | Matched via the large building dictionary (per-floor postal codes) |
| `"jigyosyo"` | Matched via the business office dictionary (dedicated postal codes) |

### What is the matching order?

The API tries to match in this order:

1. **Jigyosyo** (business offices) -- For names like "宮内庁", "日本銀行"
2. **Tatemono** (large buildings) -- For names like "六本木ヒルズ森タワー"
3. **Standard address** -- For regular street addresses using MLIT + Japan Post data

### What happens if an address is not found?

The API returns HTTP 404 with a JSON error body:

```json
{
  "detail": "住所が見つかりませんでした: <input>"
}
```

In batch mode, individual failures are reported per-item with `success: false` and an `error` message, while the batch itself returns HTTP 200.

### Are coordinates accurate?

Coordinates come from MLIT data and represent the block or town-level centroid. They are not pinpoint building-level coordinates. Accuracy is typically within a few hundred meters for block-level matches and within a few kilometers for town-level matches.

### How do I handle rate limiting?

When rate-limited (HTTP 429), check the `Retry-After` header for the number of seconds to wait. The `X-RateLimit-Global-Remaining` header shows how many requests remain in the current hour.

```bash
# Check current rate limit status
curl https://api.jusho.dev/rate-limit-status
```

---

## Performance

### Why is the first request slow?

The first request to a fresh server instance triggers loading of dictionary data (~800MB in memory). This takes several seconds. Subsequent requests are fast.

To avoid cold-start delays:

```bash
# Trigger background data loading
curl -X POST https://api.jusho.dev/warmup

# Check if data is loaded
curl https://api.jusho.dev/ready
```

### How fast are subsequent requests?

After data is loaded, normalization typically completes in a few milliseconds.

### Should I use GET or POST for single addresses?

Both `GET /normalize?address=...` and `POST /normalize` return identical results. Use GET for simple integrations and testing. Use POST when the address contains characters that are difficult to URL-encode or when you want a cleaner API interface.

### When should I use batch mode?

Use `POST /normalize/batch` when you have multiple addresses to process. It accepts up to 100 addresses per request and is more efficient than making 100 individual requests.

## Data

### How often is the data updated?

The underlying government data is typically updated monthly:

- **KEN_ALL** (Japan Post): Updated monthly at [https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/download.html](https://www.post.japanpost.jp/zipcode/download.html)
- **KOKUDO** (MLIT): Updated periodically at [https://nlftp.mlit.go.jp/isj/](https://nlftp.mlit.go.jp/isj/)

### Does Jusho handle address changes from municipal mergers?

Yes, Jusho includes corrections for known municipal mergers. For example, Hamamatsu City's ward restructuring (2024) is handled, where former Naka-ku, Higashi-ku, Nishi-ku, and Minami-ku were merged into Chuo-ku.

### Does Jusho support Kyoto-style addresses?

Yes. Kyoto addresses with "toorina" (street intersection references like "上ル", "下ル", "東入", "西入") are recognized and preserved.

---

## Integration

### Can I use Jusho from a browser?

Yes. The API supports CORS (`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`), so you can call it directly from client-side JavaScript. The TypeScript SDK works in both Node.js and browsers.

### Does Jusho support MCP (Model Context Protocol)?

Yes. Jusho has a built-in MCP server at `/mcp`. See the [MCP Integration Guide](mcp-integration.md) for configuration details.

### Can I self-host Jusho?

Yes. The backend is a Python (FastAPI) application that can be deployed as a Docker container. See the project repository for deployment instructions.

```bash
# Build and run locally
cd backend
docker build -t jusho .
docker run -p 8080:8080 jusho
```

### What are the system requirements for self-hosting?

- **Memory**: At least 4GB RAM (dictionary data is ~800MB in memory)
- **CPU**: 1+ cores
- **Python**: 3.9+ (3.11 recommended)
- **Storage**: ~1GB for data files

## Troubleshooting

### I get `422 Validation Error`

Ensure you are sending a valid JSON body for POST requests:

```bash
# Correct
curl -X POST https://api.jusho.dev/normalize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"address": "東京都千代田区千代田1-1"}'

# Wrong (missing Content-Type)
curl -X POST https://api.jusho.dev/normalize \
  -d '{"address": "東京都千代田区千代田1-1"}'
```

### I get `404 Not Found` for a valid address

Some edge cases may not be in the current dictionary data. If you believe an address should be found, check:

1. Is the address using standard Japanese notation?
2. Is the municipality name current (not a pre-merger name)?
3. Does the address include at least prefecture + city + town?

### Batch request returns mixed results

This is expected behavior. In batch mode, each address is processed independently. Some may succeed and others may fail. Check the `success` flag on each item in the `results` array.
